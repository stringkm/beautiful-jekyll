I currently study RR Lyrae stars, which are stars about the mass of the Sun that have started to die. During this process, their atmospheres become unstable and start to pulsate, causing them to change brightness in a repeating pattern. Thanks to a well-studied relationship between their intrinsic brightness and how fast they pulsate, if you measure an RR Lyrae star's **period**, or how long it takes to complete one cycle of pulsation, you can estimate how far away it is. For more information about RR Lyrae, the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) has an excellent [article on these stars](https://www.aavso.org/vsots_rrlyr).

My research specifically focuses on identifying these stars using very few observations taken in multiple filters. This is difficult to do because you typically need many observations in one filter to correctly estimate the period. Due to their changing surface temperatures, the light from RR Lyrae stars changes color over the course of these pulsations. Because of this, the brightness of an RR Lyrae changes different amounts depending on which filter you use to observe it. This makes it difficult to combine data from different filters to estimate the period. The data I use from the Dark Energy Survey only has 4-5 observations in each filter so far.
