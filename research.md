I currently study RR Lyrae stars, which are stars about the mass of the Sun or slightly less which have started to die. During this process, their atmospheres become unstable and start to pulsate, causing them to change brightness in a repeating pattern. Thanks to a well-studied relationship between their intrinsic brightness and how fast they pulsate, if you measure an RR Lyrae star's _period_, or how long it takes to complete one cycle of pulsation, you can estimate how far away it is. For more information about RR Lyrae, the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) has an excellent [article on these stars](https://www.aavso.org/vsots_rrlyr).
