I currently study RR Lyrae stars, which are stars about the mass of the Sun that have started to die. During this process, their atmospheres become unstable and start to pulsate, causing them to change brightness (measured in units called **magnitudes**) in a repeating pattern. A plot of these changes in brightness over time is called a **light curve**. Thanks to a well-studied relationship between their intrinsic brightness and how fast they pulsate, if you measure an RR Lyrae star's **period**, or how long it takes to complete one cycle of pulsation, you can estimate how far away it is. Because of this, RR Lyrae stars are very useful for determining distances to star clusters and galaxies, and can even be used to find them! 

My research specifically focuses on identifying these stars using very few observations taken in multiple filters. This is difficult because you typically need many observations in one filter to correctly estimate the period, but the data I use from the Dark Energy Survey only has 4-5 observations in each filter so far. The brightness of an RR Lyrae changes different amounts depending on which filter you use to observe it, so it is difficult to combine data from different filters to estimate the period. My previous advisor, [Prof. James Long](https://longjp.github.io/), developed a model that takes these filter offsets into account and uses all the data simultaneously to estimate the period. Below is a figure of this model in action on DES data from a real RR Lyrae star.
