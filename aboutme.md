Hello! Welcome to my page! My name is Katelyn Stringer and I'm a PhD student in astronomy advised by [Professor Lucas Macri](http://people.physics.tamu.edu/lmacri/) at Texas A&M University. My research focus is time series analysis and classification of variable stars. For more information, please click the "Research" tab. Besides that: 

- I teach an undergraduate astronomy lab course. For more information, please click the "ASTR 102" tab. ([website](http://observatory.tamu.edu/courses/observational/)).
- I co-lead [SUPA](https://people.physics.tamu.edu/aibhleog/supa/home.html), a diversity organization in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, along with [Taylor Hutchison](https://people.physics.tamu.edu/aibhleog/), Sarah Cantu, and [Tarini Konchady](https://tkonchady.github.io/))

- Outside of school, I love reading fantasy and young adult fiction, playing video games, and creating poorly-made latte art with my espresso machine.
