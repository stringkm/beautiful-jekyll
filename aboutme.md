title: About me
---

Hello! Welcome to my page! My name is Katelyn Stringer and I'm a PhD student in astronomy at Texas A&M University. My research focus is time series analysis and classification, which I am applying towards identifying variable stars (RR Lyrae) in sparsely sampled survey observations. Besides that: 

- I teach an undergraduate astronomy lab course ([website](http://observatory.tamu.edu/courses/observational/)).
- I co-lead [SUPA](https://people.physics.tamu.edu/aibhleog/supa/home.html), a diversity organization in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, along with [Taylor Hutchison](https://people.physics.tamu.edu/aibhleog/), Sarah Cantu, and [Tarini Konchady](https://tkonchady.github.io/))

- Outside of school, I love to read fantasy and young adult fiction, play video games, and create poorly-made latte art with my espresso machine.
